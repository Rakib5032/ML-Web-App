📋 Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Virtual environment (recommended)

🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository
    git clone <https://github.com/Rakib5032/ML-Web-App.git>
    cd ml_web_app

2. Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment
    
    On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate

    On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

4. Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. lace your trained models

    Ensure random_forest_model.pkl is in the models/ directory
    Ensure preprocessor.pkl is in the models/ directory

🚀 Running the Application
1. Start the Flask development server
    python app.py

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
    http://localhost:5000

🎯 How to Use
Web Interface
1. Navigate to the home page
2. Fill in the IoT system parameters:
Data Size (KB)
    Processing Time (ms)
    Attack Severity (0-10 scale)
    Blockchain Transaction Time (ms)
    Energy Consumption (mJ)
    IoT Layer (Device/Network/Application)
    Request Type
    Security Threat Type
    Consensus Mechanism

3. Click "Analyze Threat Level"
4. View the detailed results with:
    Threat status (Mitigated/Detected)
    Confidence percentage
    Recommendations
    Security best practices

REST API
Send POST requests to /api/predict with JSON data:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/predict \


🔧 Configuration
Environment Variables
You can set the following environment variables:

FLASK_ENV: Set to development for development mode
FLASK_DEBUG: Set to 1 to enable debug mode
PORT: Port number for the application (default: 5000)
Model Files
The application expects the following files in the models/ directory:

random_forest_model.pkl: Trained Random Forest model
preprocessor.pkl: Data preprocessing pipeline
If these files are not found, the application will use a fallback prediction method.
